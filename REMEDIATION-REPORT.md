# August 2026 remediation report

Branch: `remediation-aug-2026`. Tracks the thirteen phase remediation run against defects
found in the August 14, 2026 live walkthrough, ahead of the group's paid season starting
September 12, 2026.

## Baseline (Phase 0)

- `ruff check .`: clean.
- `black --check .`: clean, 60 files.
- `pytest -q`: **939 passed**, 0 failed. This is the baseline test count; Phase 10 requires
  at least 80 more (1019+) after remediation.
- Em dash grep: clean (the one hit in `tests/test_app.py:2370` is an assertion that em dashes
  are absent, not a violation).
- Branch `remediation-aug-2026` created from `main` at commit `c210499`.
